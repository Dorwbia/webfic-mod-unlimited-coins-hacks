Webfic app Mod 100K free coins unlock chapters, get free reading novels Hacks - You gain your chest by causing harm to your boss, not by staging checkpoints. The damage during the boss stage is cumulative. Causing harm to the boss and resulting in death will retain the damage you caused during your last run. The boss you want to confront depends on your main campaign progress. In most cases, you will be fighting against the boss you cleared in the previous stage. The weapons you can use depend on the stage - if the stage gives you saws/lasers/machine guns, then these are the weapons you can use in boss battles. Once you have all the boss chests, you will spend a key. The key can be obtained from the completion stage or purchased with real money. Over time, you will not receive a free key.
